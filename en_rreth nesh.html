&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Zekate House was built in mid 1811 and 1812, a time which coincides with the efforts of Ali Pasha, to enlarge the Castle. It was built for one of the richest citizens, Bekir Zeko, who was an accountant at the time of Ali Pasha. He conceived the house for his two sons, Mustafa and Feimi. Zekate House is considered unique in the entire Balkan region for the size and its architectural wealth. At the time of the communist regime, this house was declared a cultural monument, and the family of Zekat was forced to live elsewhere. After the promulgation of democracy, the property was given back to the family who began restoration and maintaining it with the assistance of the Organization for Development and Conservation of the City of Gjirokastra. In 2005, Gjirokastra entered UNESCO and Zekate House resumed taking the values and glory of the past ...<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Zekate House consists of a special construction of: walls of stone, about a meter thick, and it has the insertion of wood element, which gives the house flexibility in case of an earthquake occurrence. Extraordinary things in this place, it is that the building is made up of high arches on columns in a structure called “kamari”, whichpurpose is to features architectural aesthetic from one side and to bear the rooms above from the other side. This house has no elements of typical homes in Ottoman times: the separation of rooms for men and women. It has the main feature of all houses in Gjirokastra, the roofs which are made up of stone.<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you enter the home, will be seen initially the rooms of friends. There is a space with an easy section, where the important people sit. The second floor has two rooms in which sat two branches of the family already. Each has a small toilet and even a Turkish bath from the heated smoke from the chimney of the adjacent room. Low couches are from three sides and shelves are located in the walls of the house. At one end is “musandra”, with a huge rack, ready to hold clothes, mattresses and other bed accessories.<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One floor above is a gallery space in the form of wood and the third floor couch is enormous, offering an exceptional view across the city attractive and the whole valley. From surrounding walls are coated with wood lathing, adjacent to a special part produced by the old lime, goat hair, egg white, clean sand mixed with straw. Rooms are large reception followed by two smaller rooms. Later that summer rooms are kept on the floor model rooms below.<br /><br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The main reception room is huge and made with different decoration, once it was used for more important cases such as weddings or celebrations. Paintings of flowers, fruits, which are typical in the so-called "Tulip Era" in Ottoman architecture during the eighteenth century, here are a reality in the walls of the house. This gave an image symbolic meaning for health, wealth and abundance of the house itself. Throughout the accompanying elements of wood careful where Ottoman feels archaic style and the elements characteristic of wood were everywhere along the walls with floral themes. Windows with colored glass forms the lunar reportedly come from Venice.
