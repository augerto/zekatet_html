  <div id="content"><p id="text-aligning">"BEST TYPE OF OTTOMAN TOWER THAT HAS SURVIVED IN GJIROKASTRA"<br />
The fortified tower houses – known as kullë (kullë is Turkish for tower) belonged to wealthy individuals such as administrative 
officials or merchants. They all follow a basic layout: a secure stone lower storey topped by a wooden gallery where the principal 
rooms for an extended family are located.  Embrasures are set in the walls to help defend against attacking enemies. The Zekate 
House is a particularly grand example of the typical kullë (tower-house).  Constructed in 1811-1812 it has twin towers and a great 
double arched façade. The views of the town and the river valley below are spectacular. 
 There are three floors; the ground floor contains storage rooms, a high ceilinged kitchen and the cistern.  There is a central 
 staircase which winds upwards through the building. The first floor has two rooms that were used as living quarters for branches 
 of the family, while the third floor has a grand reception room and two other smaller rooms. The principal room is very typical 
 of the grandest of these dwellings with frescoed walls, a carved ceiling and an ornate fireplace.  This level would have been 
 shared by the whole family.  At the centre of floor at the top of the staircase there is a wooden balcony overlooking the town.  
 This has a raised section on which the head of the family would sit, meet his guests and watch what went on in the city below.
